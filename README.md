>> BEEP BOOP << 
This GR4D-BOT v2.0 program simulates a robo-pedagogical grading system. Users can 
input student (or “unit”) information, including name, course, year, section, and 
grades.
>>
>> The bot evaluates each unit’s average grade and assigns a performance 
standing such as "With Highest Honors" or "Failed," using futuristic robot language 
and error-checking for invalid inputs.
>>
>> The interface mimics a robotic console, 
complete with command prompts, error messages, and data analysis reports, 
offering both a fun and educational experience with robust input validation.
